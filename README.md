# demo.core

Just a demo of cljs and re-frame.

## Overview

See https://figwheel.org/docs/emacs.html, also https://docs.cider.mx/cider/basics/clojurescript.html

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig:build

or, in Emacs:

    M-x cider-jack-in-cljs

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the need to
reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will get a Browser
Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein clean
	lein fig:min
